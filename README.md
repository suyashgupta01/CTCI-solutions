# CTCI-solutions
### This repository contains all of my solutions to "Cracking the coding interview" (by Gayle Laakmann McDowell) in C++. 

The solutions given in the book are in Java and hence I've created this repo. Also, every file contains appropriate comments that include the thought processes undertaken to solve the problem. At times, for each question, I have given several solutions, these include my own approaches along with the ones mentioned in the book.

PS: CareerCup does mentain an official repo. for the solutions in C++. Here's the link for anyone interested: https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-cpp
